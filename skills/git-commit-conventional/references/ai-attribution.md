# AI Attribution for Commits

Use this policy when creating commits through the `git-commit-conventional` skill.

## Policy

- Always include `Co-Authored-By` attribution for agent-created commits.
- Add attribution in the footer only.
- Do not mention AI generation in subject or body text.

## Attribution Source

- Use best effort self-identification to determine AI name and email from runtime/model self-awareness metadata.
- If email is not readily available, use `no-reply@example.com`.
- If name is not readily available, use `AI Assistant`.

## Missing Identity Rule

- Do not block the commit flow with a user prompt for attribution identity.
- Build attribution with available self-identified values and the fallback defaults above.

## Footer Format

```text
Co-Authored-By: <name> <email>
```

## Example

```text
fix(auth): handle refresh token expiry race

Prevent duplicate refresh requests from invalidating active sessions during token rollover.

Refs #123
Co-Authored-By: Model Name <noreply@example.com>
```

## Anti-Patterns

- Invalid subject/body content:
  - `feat: add report generation with AI`
  - `This change was generated by AI tooling.`
- Invalid placement:
  - Attribution line in subject or body instead of footer.
