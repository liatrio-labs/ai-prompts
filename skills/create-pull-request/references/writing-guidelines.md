# Section Writing Guidelines

## Why?

- Start with the problem statement and desired outcome.
- Tie rationale to concrete evidence from commits/issues/discussions.
- Quantify impact when credible data is available.

## What Changed?

- Focus on outcomes and behavior, not low-level implementation detail.
- Group related changes for reviewer readability.
- Mention principal files/directories so reviewers can navigate quickly.

## Additional Notes

- Explicitly call out breaking changes and migration steps.
- Cover testing strategy and any known risk areas.
- Document dependency/config changes and limitations.
- Link related issues using repository conventions.

## Review Checklist

- Keep checklist relevant to the actual scope.
- Include only actionable review signals.
- Mark non-applicable items as `N/A` when needed.

## Style and Quality

- Keep language concise, professional, and reviewer-friendly.
- Avoid speculation; label unknowns explicitly.
- Prefer evidence-backed statements over assumptions.
